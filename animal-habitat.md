Animal habitat

Because of their size, adult camel spiders need a 10- to 15-gallon enclosure. Their jaws are strong enough to tear mesh, so the lid needs to be made of bite-proof material such as heavy plastic or glass, with air holes drilled in. Always fasten the lid securely, because camel spiders can climb, are extremely fast and can quickly lose themselves in your home if they escape. Place a 4 to 6 inches deep substrate of sand, peat moss or potting soil in the enclosure, so your camel spider can burrow. Also provide a wide but shallow water dish and hiding areas, such as cork bark, logs and rocks. Maintain low humidity during the day, with temperatures of 80 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. At night when your camel spider is naturally most active, lower the temp to around 75 degrees Fahrenheit, and mist to raise the humidity level to around 70 percent.

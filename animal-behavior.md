# Animal behavior

With such a wide variety of species, behavior varies greatly. Most species are nocturnal, primarily to avoid the intense heat in the desert. The vast majority are solitary, and only interact with others for the purpose of reproduction. Some species are known to cannibalize one another, or fight viciously when they interact.

They are distributed across Australasia, Southern and Eastern Asia with one species from Africa. Females can grow up to 1 to 3 centimetres (0.39 to 1.18 in) long, while males reach only 2 millimetres (0.079 in) long. The name is a combination of the Ancient Greek "arachne-" (ἀράχνη) and "uro" (οὐρά), meaning "tail". The tails are only present on females, but unlike the common names suggests, these spiders aren't related to scorpions.

They curl up their tails when disturbed, but they are completely harmless. Bites are rare, and result in minor symptoms such as local pain and swelling. They stay at the middle of their web day and night, and their bodies mimic plant litter, such as fallen flowers, twigs, or dead leaves.

Spiders exhibit varying levels of sociality. Whereas most spiders are solitary and even aggressive toward other members of their own species, some hundreds of species in several families show a tendency to live in groups, often referred to as colonies. These can form relatively long-lasting aggregations. Some of these aggregations can contain as many as 50,000 individuals as in the case of Anelosimus eximius (in the family Theridiidae).[21] The level of sociality often varies between species (interspecies) but can vary within a species (intraspecies) as well. Many of these social spiders show cooperative brood care, use the same nest (web), and have some amount of generational overlap.[22] A few species, such as Anelosimus eximius, exhibit reproductive division of labor. Some biologists argue that this classifies these species as fully eusocial as these non-reproductives can be considered a non-sterile worker caste. This reproductive division of labor is a result of resource availability and monopolization of those resources.

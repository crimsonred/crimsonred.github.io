Animal behavior

With such a wide variety of species, behavior varies greatly. Most species are nocturnal, primarily to avoid the intense heat in the desert. The vast majority are solitary, and only interact with others for the purpose of reproduction. Some species are known to cannibalize one another, or fight viciously when they interact.
